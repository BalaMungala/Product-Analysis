Business Scenario :


Mike Goodman, the head of Product Management for a retail products company, is also responsible for product pricing. Mike needs to determine if his products are appropriately priced to maximize both sales and profit ratio. Mike wants to build a dashboard that will present sales by product category over time, with the ability to drill down to the product and regional level. Mike also wants to be able to click on a specific product name to do a Google search for that product and to look at competitorsâ€™ pricing levels.
